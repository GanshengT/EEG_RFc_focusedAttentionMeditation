# EEG signals R-language analysis and classification 

This project refers to the 2018-2019 **Brain-Computer Interface based on the Relaxation state** in CentraleSup√©lec L2S laboratory. Here are
some available functions for analysing EEG signals as well as skin conductance, skin temperature, heart rate and respiration rate. These 
functions are helpful to build a machine-learning classifiers, two classifier random forest and SVM are embedded.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites
* install R-studio and appopriate [R environment] (https://www.rstudio.com/)
* the data should be in txt format with sample rate of 256, you can refer to the example in this repository


### Installing packages
The functions use certain R packages, make sure you install them before runing
install library using `install.package("signal")` for example



## Function argument and output



### correlation_MOHU

This is a script that help you be acquainted with R-processing of EEG signals. 

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
